Rails/DefaultScope:
  Enabled: true
  Details: >-
    Default scopes lead to unexpected behavior for future devs, use named scopes where needed.
Rails/OrderById:
  Enabled: true
  Details: >-
    No guaranteed order by id, use timestamps (created_at/updated_at) or no order at all.
Rails/SaveBang:
  Enabled: true
  Include:
    - 'spec/**/*' # TODO: enable everywhere?
  Details: >-
    Specs should fail if saved/updated record is invalid.

RSpec/LetSetup:
  Details: >-
    Let bangs (!) lead to unnecessary database calls during test execution.
    They can also obscure what setup is necessary for the test.
    Instead of immediate execution in a let!, call the variable where it is necessary: that is,
    where tests or other variables depend on it: in an example before `subject`, a before block,
    or the let block of a dependant variable:
      let(:some_needed_thing) { create(:bang) }
      let(:dependent_thing) do
        some_needed_thing # instead of let!(:some_needed_thing) above
        create(:dependent_thing)
      end
