  #
  #                                  Specify one of the following options for this property:
  #

  #                                      the request and the value currently stored for the blob.
  #     * +:update+                    - Sets the sequence number to the value included with the request.
  #     * +:increment+                 - Increments the value of the sequence number by 1. If specifying this
  #                                      option, do not include the sequence_number option; doing so will return

  #
  # * +:sequence_number+           - Integer. This property sets the blob's sequence number. The sequence number is a
  #                                  user-controlled property that you can use to track requests and manage concurrency
  #                                  issues. Required if the :sequence_number_action option is set to :max or :update.
  #                                  This property applies to page blobs only.
  #
  #                                  Use this together with the :sequence_number_action to update the blob's sequence

  #                                  the request or currently stored with the blob.
  #
  #                                  This header should not be specified if :sequence_number_action is set to :increment;

  #                                  lease, specify the valid lease ID for this header.
  #
  # Remarks:
  #
  # The semantics for updating a blob's properties are as follows:
  #
  # * A page blob's sequence number is updated only if the request meets either of the following conditions:
  #
  #     * The :sequence_number_action property is set to :max or :update, and a value for :sequence_number is also set.
  #     * The :sequence_number_action property is set to :increment, indicating that the service should increment
  #       the sequence number by one.
  #
  # * The size of the page blob is modified only if a value for :content_length is specified.
  #
  # * If :sequence_number and/or :content_length are the only properties specified, then the other properties of the blob
  #   will NOT be modified.
  #
  # * If any one or more of the following properties are set, then all of these properties are set together. If a value is
  #   not provided for a given property when at least one of the properties listed below is set, then that property will be
  #   cleared for the blob.
  #
  #     * :cache_control
  #     * :content_type
  #     * :content_md5
  #     * :content_encoding
  #     * :content_language

  #                                  issues. Required if the 'action' parameter is set to :max or :update.
  #                                  This property applies to page blobs only.
  #
  #                                  Use this together with the 'action' parameter to update the blob's sequence
  #                                  number, either to the specified value or to the higher of the values specified with
  #                                  the request or currently stored with the blob.
  #
  #                                  This header should not be specified if the 'action' parameter is set to :increment;
  #                                  in this case the service automatically increments the sequence number by one.
  #
  #                                  To set the sequence number to a value of your choosing, this property must be specified
  #                                  together with the 'action' parameter
  # * +options+                    - Hash. Optional parameters.

  # * +:timeout+                   - Integer. A timeout in seconds.
  # * +:request_id+                - String. Provides a client-generated, opaque value with a 1 KB character limit that is recorded
  #                                  in the analytics logs when storage analytics logging is enabled.
  # * +:if_modified_since+         - String. A DateTime value. Specify this conditional header to set the blob properties
  #                                  only if the blob has been modified since the specified date/time. If the blob has not been modified,
  #                                  the Blob service returns status code 412 (Precondition Failed).
  # * +:if_unmodified_since+       - String. A DateTime value. Specify this conditional header to set the blob properties

  # * +:if_match+                  - String. An ETag value. Specify an ETag value for this conditional header to set the blob properties
  #                                  only if the blob's ETag value matches the value specified. If the values do not match,
  #                                  the Blob service returns status code 412 (Precondition Failed).
  # * +:if_none_match+             - String. An ETag value. Specify an ETag value for this conditional header to set the blob properties
  #                                  only if the blob's ETag value does not match the value specified. If the values are identical,

  #                                  broken, between 0 and 60 seconds. This break period is only used if it is shorter than
  #                                  the time remaining on the lease. If longer, the time remaining on the lease is used. A
  #                                  new lease will not be available before the break period has expired, but the lease may
  #                                  be held for longer than the break period.
  #
  #                                  If this option is not used, a fixed-duration lease breaks after the remaining lease
  #                                  period elapses, and an infinite lease breaks immediately.
  # * +:timeout+                   - Integer. A timeout in seconds.
