  # Public: Copies a snapshot of the source page blob to a destination page blob. The snapshot is copied such that only
  # the differential changes between the previously copied snapshot are transferred to the destination. The copied snapshots
  # are complete copies of the original snapshot and can be read or copied from as usual.The destination of an incremental copy
  # must either not exist, or must have been created with a previous incremental copy from the same source blob. Once created,
  # the destination blob is permanently associated with the source and may only be used for incremental copies. The Get Blob
  # Properties and List Blobs APIs indicate whether the blob is an incremental copy blob created in this way. Incremental
  # copy blobs may not be downloaded directly. The only supported operations are Get Blob Properties, Incremental Copy Blob,
  # and Delete Blob. The copied snapshots may be read and deleted as usual.

  #                                  user-controlled property that you can use to track requests and manage concurrency
  #                                  issues. Required if the :sequence_number_action option is set to :max or :update.
  #                                  This property applies to page blobs only.
  #
  #                                  Use this together with the :sequence_number_action to update the blob's sequence

  # * +:if_unmodified_since+       - String. A DateTime value. Specify this conditional header to set the blob properties
  #                                  only if the blob has not been modified since the specified date/time. If the blob has been modified,

  # * +:lease_id+                  - String. Required if the blob has an active lease. To perform this operation on a blob with an active
  #                                  lease, specify the valid lease ID for this header.
  #
  # Remarks:
  #
  # The semantics for updating a blob's properties are as follows:
  #
  # * A page blob's sequence number is updated only if the request meets either of the following conditions:
  #
  #     * The :sequence_number_action property is set to :max or :update, and a value for :sequence_number is also set.
  #     * The :sequence_number_action property is set to :increment, indicating that the service should increment
  #       the sequence number by one.
  #
  # * The size of the page blob is modified only if a value for :content_length is specified.
  #
  # * If :sequence_number and/or :content_length are the only properties specified, then the other properties of the blob
  #   will NOT be modified.
  #
  # * If any one or more of the following properties are set, then all of these properties are set together. If a value is
  #   not provided for a given property when at least one of the properties listed below is set, then that property will be
  #   cleared for the blob.
  #
  #     * :cache_control
  #     * :content_type
  #     * :content_md5
  #     * :content_encoding
  #     * :content_language

  #                                  broken, between 0 and 60 seconds. This break period is only used if it is shorter than
  #                                  the time remaining on the lease. If longer, the time remaining on the lease is used. A
  #                                  new lease will not be available before the break period has expired, but the lease may
  #                                  be held for longer than the break period.
  #
  #                                  If this option is not used, a fixed-duration lease breaks after the remaining lease
  #                                  period elapses, and an infinite lease breaks immediately.
  # * +:timeout+                   - Integer. A timeout in seconds.
