  A <%= @resource.casa_org.display_name %>â€™s County <%= @resource.type %> console account has been created for you.

You can log activity with your CASA youth, their family members, their foster family or placement, the DSS worker, your Case Supervisor and others associated with your CASA case (such as teachers and therapists).
